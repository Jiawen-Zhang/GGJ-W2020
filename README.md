# GGJ-W2020

In 2021, humanity is facing the greatest crisis of all time, the coronavirus has infected 95% of human beings on planet earth. However, a hero showed up, with the cure that invented by Dr.Wong in his hand. Due to the total destruction of cities and roads, the hero must travel by foot and deliver the cure to every poor infected soul, therefore a great adventure starts.

We developed the game in around 24 hours. It was our first time doing the game design; it was our first time using Unity; it was our first time hacking a game jam. So many first times, but we made it.
